Exploratory data analysis of cannabis businesses in Minnesota following legalization in 2023

Cannabis was legalized in Minnesota for medicinal use in 2014 and for recreational use in 2023. As part of the 2023 legislation, the Office of Cannabis Management was established to set up a regulatory framework along with 12 types of commercial licenses. By law, Minnesota's 11 Indian Tribal governments are exempt from most of state regulations.

This analysis aims to answer the following questions about cannabis-related businesses following legalization:
What is the initial distribution of cannabis-related businesses in the state?
How does the distribution of cannabis-related businesses relate to existing cannabis use?
Are cannabis-related businesses distribute evenly across economic status across the state?


The Office of Cannabis Management (OCM) provides a downloaded list of registered businesses that sell products in person or online and manufacturers/wholesalers that have voluntarily registered. https://mn.gov/ocm/businesses/cannabinoid-products/registered-businesses.jsp
